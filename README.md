okfi-sdk
========

Description
===========

Low level SDK to access FIWARE Orion and OpenStack Keystone.
The goal of this library is to simplify client access to those
technologies.
In particular authentication should be handled almost automatically by
this tool: if a request fails due to authentication, authentication is
retried.

Status
======

This code is in the very early stage of development, its API will
probably change often, it is probably full of BUGs.
Feel free to provide fixes, if you find any issue.
